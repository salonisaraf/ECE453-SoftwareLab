## ECE453-SoftwareLab
These modules define our project's user interaction with the De1-SoC. 
The user is able to toggle a switch on the board that starts and ends a new user session at the workstation in the web application along with setting the LED availability indicator of the workstation.
The user is also able to interact with a capacitive touch switch board to vary the lamp's brightness level.

## These files are written specifically for the De1-SoC and must be compiled with Quartus before loading onto the De1-SoC.
